> CommerceSystem


My system is a-like Shopify, and WooCommerce. However it is built on PHP, JS, HTML, and CSS. I want my system to one-day be curated by an open-source community, because I know how much of a struggle creating such a big platform. For now I am the Author (Unkn√∏wen Gee)

Feel free to remix my git repository, and customize my current CSS and current code if you'd like. Please credit myself and other libraries in my current work.
